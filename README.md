# Ohloss — Lore & Worldbuilding

Welcome to Ohloss, a living fantasy world built around games, power, and the systems that shape who gets to rule the realm of Awen.

This repository contains the official lore, factions, characters, narrative foundations, and gameplay guides for the Ohloss universe.

## The World of Awen

Awen is a realm once held together by shared games and shared power.

At the heart of Awen are faction points — a finite form of power created through competition, creativity, and contest. For generations, the people of Awen played a single, open game to earn them. Victory strengthened clans, enriched lands, and kept the realm in balance.

Then came Empress Zebulita.

Disguised as a harmless diplomatic service robot, Zebulita promised fairness. She centralized the game. She standardized the ledgers. She locked the vault.

Now, faction points flow only where she allows.

In response, the people of Awen began creating their own games — in taverns, libraries, marketplaces, and back alleys — quietly generating new faction points beyond Zebulita's control.

The games are back.
The power is moving again.
And the throne is no longer secure.

## The Factions

### Gilded Fin

River-delta daredevils who thrive on luck, audacity, and risk.
Smugglers, traders, pirates, and gamblers who believe chance favors the bold.

**Hero:** Luck Fish
**Motto:** "I've got an idea, and a very fast ship."

### Wobblestone Clan

Mountain-born builders, stonemasons, and horsemasters who value balance, discipline, and craft.
Their strength comes from preparation, coordination, and things that endure.

**Hero:** Stonecrane
**Motto:** "Stone doesn't bend. Neither do we."

### Verdant Hollow

Historians, archivists, and keepers of living memory.
They believe knowledge is power — especially the kind that grows, adapts, and survives.

**Hero:** Maestro Noteleaf
**Motto:** "Peace is our preference. But not our position."

## The Empress

Zebulita did not seize power through force.
She won it through charm, calculation, and control.

Every kindness is a strategy.
Every rule is a trap.
