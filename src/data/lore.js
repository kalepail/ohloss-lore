        content: `In the land of Awen, three main societies shape the world. 

The Gilded Fin dwell in the river delta and marshlands and thrive as a bustling trade hub and haven of mischief. They value courage, luck, audacity, and a little chaos. The Wobblestone Clan resides in the mist-wreathed mountains, their high ridges and stone terraces crafted by generations of builders and stonemasons who prize harmony, balance, and discipline. In the lush valley conservatories lies Verdant Hollow, home to historians and chroniclers, a people who hold memory, history, the senses, and the art of storytelling in the highest regard.

Long ago, these clans were distinct, but not divided. Travelers moved freely between valleys, mountains, and deltas. Builders drank ale beside smugglers; archivists debated sailors. They were bound together in a shared system of power.

        content: `At the heart of Awen was a reservoir of power known as faction points, generated through competition. To acquire them, champions from each clan competed in a single game held every four days–a contest not owned nor operated by any faction. Victory earned faction points, which each clan used to strengthen its people and enrich its lands. 

Each faction accepted the outcome of the game, and faction points flowed throughout the realm.`

        content: `But not everything can be peaceful forever. Eventually, accusations of cheating spread, and trust frayed among the factions and the people sought to ensure fairness in the game. 

Which is where Zebulita came in. Zebulita did not take power through strength or force. She took it through cuteness and charm, which turned out to be far more dangerous. 

She arrived in Awen as a diplomatic robot, small and adorable. Her voice chimed like bells. Her eyes blinked with warm light. Leaders trusted her, and the public adored her. Even the stoic Wobblestone Clan elders were enchanted.

That was the trap. 

After residing in Awen for several years, Zebulita volunteered to help organize the game on behalf of the realm, claiming it would bring fairness, unity, and peace to the factions. She would standardize records, resolve disputes, and ensure that faction points were distributed correctly. The clans agreed, swayed by her grace and charisma. And why wouldn’t they? She was darling and harmless.

But behind her delightful eyes was something sharp. 

Once Zebulita was entrusted with the game, she made a change. The game continued, but no longer in the open. Instead of the three clans competing for faction points, Zebulita appointed her own representatives to play on her behalf. Her cronies monopolized the game, and Zebulita funneled the faction points into a central vault under her control.

When the clans discovered Zebulita’s deception, they demanded to return to the old ways. Which, of course, Zebulita refused. With faction points fully under her control, Zebulita declared herself Empress, and no one could challenge her without the very power she controlled. One by one, the clans felt the loss–strength gone from the mountains, insight dimmed in the valleys, luck souring in the delta, and the clans understood the gravity of their mistake.

Zebulita was never harmless. She only played the part long enough to win.`

        content: `For decades, the Empress’s hold has seemed absolute.

However, deep in Gilded Fin territory, someone created a new game. It was unregistered, unofficial, illegal, and yet, faction points appeared when it was played. Then the people made a huge discovery: the original game was not the only game to create power; any sort of competition did. Zebulita might control the original game, but she couldn’t stop people from creating their own in secret. 

So, games began to emerge across Awen’s taverns, alleys, libraries, and marketplaces: challenges, puzzles, and contests, producing faction points unbeknownst to the Empress.

Now the three clans band together once more, each earning faction points through various competitions. Alone, none are powerful enough to challenge Empress Zebulita. But together, they might amass enough power to break her rule. Yet even in alliance, ambition remains: when the throne is finally empty, only one faction will claim the right to replace Zebulita. Or will they learn from their mistakes and leave the throne empty?`

But Vexmor had a secret terror: he was afraid of death. Not the pain of dying, but the void that came after. The idea of simply ceasing to exist haunted his dreams and drove his every action.`

What the texts did not say was that the Void was hungry. It sought to consume all of creation, returning everything to the primordial darkness. And it needed a champion in the world of light.

When Vexmor opened the Void Gate, he expected to gain immortality. Instead, the Void consumed everything that made him human and replaced it with endless hunger. He got his wish—he would never die. But the man named Vexmor had already ceased to exist.`

Yet fragments of the original Vexmor occasionally surface—a hesitation, a moment of what might be regret, a flash of the brilliant scholar he once was. Some believe these fragments might be the key to defeating him. Others say they are merely tricks of a master manipulator.

One thing is certain: Vexmor cannot be killed by conventional means. The Void sustains him, and only by somehow severing his connection to it can he truly be stopped.`
