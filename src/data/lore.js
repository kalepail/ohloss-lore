        content: `Before time had meaning, there existed only the Primordial Light and the Endless Void—two forces in eternal equilibrium. Neither could overcome the other, and in their eternal dance, sparks of creation flew into the nothingness between them.

These sparks became the seeds of worlds, and among them, one seed grew brighter than all others. This was Ohloss, born from equal parts light and shadow, a world destined to be the battleground for the eternal conflict.`

        content: `For countless millennia, Ohloss flourished in balance. The first peoples—the Elder Races—understood that light and dark were not enemies but partners in the cosmic dance. They built great civilizations that honored both forces, and magic flowed freely through the world.

The Elder Druids of the Verdant Circle tended to nature. The Arcanum Council pursued knowledge. The warrior clans protected the innocent. Peace reigned, though none knew it was built on a foundation that would one day crack.`

        heading: 'The Fall of Vexmor',
        content: `Among the greatest mages of the Arcanum Council was Vexmor, a scholar whose brilliance was matched only by his fear of death. He watched his mentors age and die, and swore he would not share their fate.

His research led him to forbidden texts that spoke of the Endless Void—the primordial darkness that existed before creation. The texts promised that those who embraced the Void would never die. They lied about the cost.

On the night that would be known as the Sundering, Vexmor opened a gate to the Void itself. The darkness that poured through consumed his humanity, his mortality, and his soul. In their place, something else took root—an undying vessel for the Void's hunger.`

        heading: 'The First Shadow War',
        content: `Vexmor, now calling himself the Undying, raised an army from the dead and corrupted. The Shadow Dominion swept across Ohloss like a plague, extinguishing the light wherever it touched.

The Elder Races united against him, but the cost was catastrophic. The Arcanum Council was destroyed—its surviving members scattered. The Elder Druids sacrificed themselves to create barriers against the shadow corruption. Entire civilizations fell into darkness.

Only the discovery of the Sacred Flame—a fragment of the Primordial Light itself—turned the tide. The survivors used it to drive Vexmor back, sealing him within the Obsidian Citadel. But they could not destroy him, for the Void had made him truly immortal.`

        content: `Three centuries have passed since the First Shadow War. The Order of the Dawn guards the Sacred Flame and maintains the seals on Vexmor's prison. But the seals are weakening.

Shadows creep at the edges of the world. Corruption spreads through ancient forests. The dead stir in their graves. Vexmor's whispers reach the ambitious and desperate, promising power to those who would serve him.

The heroes of this age must decide: Will they stand with the light? Embrace the darkness? Or seek a third path—the way of balance that the Twilight Covenant believes is the only true salvation?

The final battle approaches. The fate of Ohloss hangs in the balance.`

        heading: 'The Man He Was',
        content: `Before he became a monster, Vexmor was perhaps the most gifted mage ever born. Child prodigy, master of seven schools of magic by age twenty, youngest-ever member of the Arcanum Council—his achievements seemed limitless.

But Vexmor had a secret terror: he was afraid of death. Not the pain of dying, but the void that came after. The idea of simply ceasing to exist haunted his dreams and drove his every action.`

        content: `In the forbidden archives beneath the Arcanum Tower, Vexmor found texts that spoke of the Endless Void—not as death, but as a form of existence. The Void, the texts claimed, was infinite and eternal. Those who joined with it would never end.

What the texts did not say was that the Void was hungry. It sought to consume all of creation, returning everything to the primordial darkness. And it needed a champion in the world of light.

When Vexmor opened the Void Gate, he expected to gain immortality. Instead, the Void consumed everything that made him human and replaced it with endless hunger. He got his wish—he would never die. But the man named Vexmor had already ceased to exist.`

        content: `What remains is something that wears Vexmor's face but serves only the Void's purpose: the extinction of all light, all life, all existence. The Shadow Dominion is simply a tool toward this end.

Yet fragments of the original Vexmor occasionally surface—a hesitation, a moment of what might be regret, a flash of the brilliant scholar he once was. Some believe these fragments might be the key to defeating him. Others say they are merely tricks of a master manipulator.

One thing is certain: Vexmor cannot be killed by conventional means. The Void sustains him, and only by somehow severing his connection to it can he truly be stopped.`
