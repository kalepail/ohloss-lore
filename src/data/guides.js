Of the total yield generated by the vault, 10% is allocated to game developers. Your share of that portion is determined by how many faction points flow through your game during that epoch, relative to the total faction points generated across all games.

For example, if your game generates 500 faction points during an epoch, and 10,000 faction points are generated across all games, you would receive 5% of the game developer portion of the yield for that epoch.

You can play games without depositing USDC into the vault, but you won't be able to claim any yield until you deposit at least 1 USDC. Learn how to acquire USDC in the [Get USDC Guide](/guides/get-usdc).

When you deposit into the vault, the system will present a snapshot of your total deposit and how long your assets have been deposited. The vault is zero-loss, meaning you can withdraw your full deposited amount at any time.

The more USDC you deposit–and the longer it stays deposited–the more faction points you acquire.

At the end of each epoch, the yield generated by the vault becomes claimable by members of the winning faction who have deposited at least 1 USDC.

The amount of yield each winning faction member can claim is proportional to the number of faction points they contributed during the epoch. Of the total yield generated by the vault for that epoch, 90% is distributed to players in the winning faction, and 10% is allocated to game developers.

For example, if the winning faction earned 100 total faction points during an epoch and you contributed 10 of those points, you can claim 10% of the player portion of the yield generated for that epoch.

Your vault deposits carry over from epoch to epoch–there's no need to redeposit USDC unless you want to increase your contribution.`

As your total deposit increases, a multiplier scales up from 1x to a maximum of 2.45x as you approach a target deposit of $1,000.

Deposits above $1,000 receive a gradually reduced multiplier, which tapers back toward 1x and reaches it again at around $10,000.
